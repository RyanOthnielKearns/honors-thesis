# Summary
In "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude", C. Thi Nguyen establishes an additional theory of trust to accompany philosophy's typically agent-oriented theories. Most previous theories of trust hold only between agents, involve central requirements like goodwill, responsiveness, or reliance on committments, and are marked by the possibility of betrayal.

Nguyen, by contrast, establishes a theory of trust based on an **unquestioning attitude** -- by this theory, to trust something is to have a strong disposition to suspend deliberation about that thing. For example, a climber trusts their climbing rope, because they aren't constantly reassuring themselves as to the rope's integrity. By contrast, to *distrust* is to remain in a state of constant questioning and skepticism.

Nguyen claims that both theories of trust -- the general agent-oriented theory and the unquestioning attitude theory -- sit under an umbrella for a more general notion of trust, and that what joins them is their purpose of expanding one's agency through integrating aspects of the external world. In this sense, we trust so to form linkages or "welds" to external objects, and we bring them into our practical and cognitive faculties. For this reason, we can talk of being *betrayed* in our trust even of non-agents, like musical instruments or the ground, because the "normative bite" comes from our desire to integrate objects in our immediate cognition and agency. When our climbing rope unexpectedly snaps, we feel betrayed because we had integrated that object into our agency and had developed an attitude of not questioning it's integrity.
# Reflection
Towards the end of this paper Nguyen hints at her unquestioning attitude as the potential basis for a new "radically non-individualist epistemology" (37). While probably spitballing a bit more than earlier parts of the paper, I thought that this angle was cool -- certainly Nguyen's account of trust is important for considering trusting relationships to technologies and tools, including uncanny valley, quasi-agential things like AI systems. There are connections to ideas about group agency, distributed cognition, and Clark's Extended Mind hypothesis that seem super worth exploring for their epistemological and even metaphysical import.

I "began" with this paper in the literature review for the thesis, in part because I think it's a great cornerstone for the philosophical discussion on trust that will be relevant to black box systems and explanation as literature concepts / hubs.
